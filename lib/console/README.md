# Console

A command-line console library which can be used to easily expose debug and
test commands via a serial interface.

## Features

The console library supports the following high-level features:
* Built-in validation of command arguments
* Auto-generated "help" command which lists all available commands, and can be
used to display usage information about specific commands (when enabled)
* Support for string and integer positional arguments, including (limited)
optional arguments
* Optimized for embedded environments with static memory allocation and the
ability to store command definitions in program memory (instead of RAM)
* Simple and easy to integrate API

## Usage

The first step is to define a console command and implement its handler. During
program initialization, `console_init()` should be called to initialize the
console library, and each command should be registered with the console library
using `console_command_register()`.

When the program receives data which should be interpreted by the console
library, it should be passed to `console_process()`. Note that the data passed
may contain a partial, complete, or even multiple commands. As part of this
call, the console library will call the command handlers, as appropriate.

### Defining Commands

To define a new console command, the `CONSOLE_COMMAND_DEF(CMD, DESC, ...)`
macro should be used (omit the `DESC` argument if the `CONSOLE_HELP_COMMAND`
option is not enabled).
* `CMD` is the name of the console command, and must be a valid C symbol name.
* `DESC` should be specified if the `CONSOLE_HELP_COMMAND` option is set, and
should be a string which describes the command for use by the `help` command.
* `...` should consist of 0 or more argument definitions (see below).

Arguments are defined as part of a console command definition with the help of
one of the following macros (omit the `DESC` argument if the
`CONSOLE_HELP_COMMAND` option is not enabled). The `NAME` argument must be a
valid C symbol name.
* `CONSOLE_INT_ARG_DEF(NAME, DESC)` - Defines a required integer argument.
* `CONSOLE_STR_ARG_DEF(NAME, DESC)` - Defines a required string argument.
* `CONSOLE_OPTIONAL_INT_ARG_DEF(NAME, DESC)` - Defines an optional integer
argument (can only be used for the last argument).
* `CONSOLE_OPTIONAL_STR_ARG_DEF(NAME, DESC)` - Defines an optional string
argument (can only be used for the last argument).

The `CONSOLE_COMMAND_DEF()` macro will forward declare a handler for the
console command with the following prototype:
`static void <CMD>_command_handler(const <CMD>_args_t* args);`. This function
will be called whenver the console command is invoked, with the `args` argument
containing the validated, parsed, and appropriately typed (`intptr_t` /
`const char*`) arguments. For optional arguments, a default value of `-1` /
`NULL` will be set for integer / string arguments respectively.

### Initializing the Library and Registering Commands

The `console_init()` function should be called before registering any commands
to initialize the console library. Console commands can be registered at any
time afterwards using the `console_command_register(CMD)` function.

## Compile Options

Parameters and additional features of the console library can be configured via
the following defines:
* `CONSOLE_MAX_COMMANDS` - The maximum number of console commands which may be
registered (default of 16).
* `CONSOLE_MAX_LINE_LENGTH` - The maximum length of a single line sent to the
console library (default of 128).
* `CONSOLE_PROMPT` - The string displayed to prompt for console input (default
of "> ").
* `CONSOLE_BUFFER_ATTRIBUTES` - Extra GCC attributes to add to the internal
buffers used by the console library (default of none). As an example, this can
be used in cases where these buffers should be placed in a different linker
section.
* `CONSOLE_HELP_COMMAND` - Enables the built-in help command (default of 1).
This can be disabled to save code space. Disabling this will also remove the
`desc` attribute of commands and arguments.
* `CONSOLE_FULL_CONTROL` - Enables more advanced line control features such as
backspace and CTRL-C (default of 1). Also enables the `console_print_line()`
function. This setting also results in the console echo'ing back any valid
characters it receives.
* `CONSOLE_TAB_COMPLETE` - Enables tab-completion of console commands (default
of 1). This depends on `CONSOLE_FULL_CONTROL` being enabled.
* `CONSOLE_HISTORY` - Enables history accessible via up/down arrow keys with
the specified command buffer size (default is 0). This depends on
`CONSOLE_FULL_CONTROL` being enabled.

## Tests

The unit tests can be run by running `make` within the `tests` directory.
These tests are built using
[googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and depend on the
`gtest` library being available on the system.

## Example

```
#include "anchor/console/console.h"

CONSOLE_COMMAND_DEF(gpio_set, "Sets a GPIO pin",
    CONSOLE_STR_ARG_DEF(port, "The port <A,B,C>"),
    CONSOLE_INT_ARG_DEF(pin, "The pin <0-15>"),
    CONSOLE_INT_ARG_DEF(value, "The value <0-1>")
);

CONSOLE_COMMAND_DEF(gpio_get, "Gets a GPIO pin value",
    CONSOLE_STR_ARG_DEF(port, "The port <A,B,C>"),
    CONSOLE_INT_ARG_DEF(pin, "The pin <0-15>")
);

static void gpio_set_command_handler(const gpio_set_args_t* args) {
    gpio_write(args->port, args->pin, args->value);
}

static void gpio_get_command_handler(const gpio_get_args_t* args) {
    printf("value=%d", gpio_read(args->port, args->pin));
}

void main(void) {
    const console_init_t init_console = {
        .write_function = console_write_function,
    };
    console_init(&init_console);
    console_command_register(gpio_set);
    console_command_register(gpio_get);

    while (true) {
        uint8_t buffer[64];
        const uint32_t len = serial_read(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        console_process(buffer, len);
        // ...
    }
}
```

```
> help
Available commands:
  help     - List all commands, or give details about a specific command
  gpio_set - Sets a GPIO pin
  gpio_get - Gets a GPIO pin value
> help gpio_get
Gets a GPIO pin value
Usage: gpio_get port pin
  port - The port <A,B,C>
  pin  - The pin <0-15>
> gpio_set A 1 1
> gpio_get A 1
value=1
> gpio_set A 1 0
> gpio_get A 1

```
